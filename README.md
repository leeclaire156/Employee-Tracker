# Employee Tracker


## Description

This project is a command-line application that functions as a content management system (CMS), able to manage a company's employee database. The main menu will allow the user to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee's role.
<!-- BONUS: Update employee managers. View employees by manager. View employees by department. Delete departments, roles, and employees. View the total utilized budget of a departmentâ€”in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.-->

This project utilizes [Node.js version 16.18.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Inquirer version 8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package from [npm, Inc.](https://www.npmjs.com/) to create a main menu for content management while utilizing the [Node MySQL 2 version 3.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) package from [npm, Inc.](https://www.npmjs.com/) to access the database for displaying and editing employee records.
